# Task 1: Multi-Page Web Scraping with Python 
This script scrapes book data from BooksToScrape.com, a website designed specifically for web-scraping practice.
- It automatically navigates through 50 pages of the catalog and extracts:
- Book Title
- Book Price
The extracted data is saved into a CSV file (books_multipage.csv) for further analysis or visualization.

The project demonstrates:
- Sending HTTP requests using requests
- Parsing HTML using BeautifulSoup
- Looping through multiple pages
- Writing structured data to a CSV file

This task serves as a foundational step for building datasets and practicing real-world data collection techniques.

# Task 3: Sales Data Visualization
This project demonstrates the transformation of raw sales data into actionable insights using Python, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 
- The dashboard combines multiple visualizations to tell a clear data story. 

Outcome: This project supports decision-making by clearly communicating sales performance, product popularity, and regional performance trends. 

# Task 4: Airline Tweets Sentiment Analysis
This project analyzes real-world airline tweets to classify customer sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative using NLP techniques and VADER sentiment scoring. 
- It includes emotion detection using the NRC lexicon to uncover deeper feelings such as anger, trust, and anticipation. 
- The data is cleaned, tokenized, and visualized through an interactive Plotly dashboard showing sentiment distribution, airline comparisons, and emotion trends. 
- Insights from the analysis help identify public opinion patterns and customer pain points. 
- These findings can support marketing decisions, improve service quality, and guide product or operational improvements.
